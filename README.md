# Mautic Contact Clients

*Note: This project is still an active work in progress and not yet ready for production.*

If you are in performance marketing you may need to send contacts to third parties (Clients),
with complex requirements that shift on a daily basis.
This means you'll be frequently writing/re-writing code, which comes with high risk and high cost.
This plugin will allow you to create a simple "integration" without touching code.

Features: 
* Queue a contact to be sent within a Campaign.
* Set exclusivity rules.
* Filter outbound contacts.
* Set throughput limits.
* Define the API/File payload to send.
* Define the measurement of a succesful send.
* Schedule sends based on days/hours/exclusions.
* Update the contact based on response (via API).
* Log the transactions for a complete audit trail.
