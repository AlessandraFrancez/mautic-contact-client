3. Click "Clients" and "Publish" the plugin.

## Payloads

You can use [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io) to format outgoing field values with any client. 
Just use the field alias, like so "{{firstname}} {{lastname}}" to send the full name, or "{{email}}" to just send the email.
Date formatting and other contextual schema is also available (documentation incoming).

## Todo
- [ ] Filtering: Rules to globally exclude contacts from sending to a client based on fields.
- [ ] Budgets: Rules to limie=t the quantity of successful contacts sent to a client.
- [ ] Files: Allow a file payload to send for clients that have no API. Contacts will queued and added to a CSV/XSL batch to be delivered to clients by FTP or email within the given schedule.
- [ ] Logging: Make the logging screen sortable/searchable. Currently this is pretty minimal (and buggy).
- [ ] Finance: Store the most recent attribution on a separate field (to be used in Campaign workflows).
- [ ] Campaign: Provide a better widget for including clients in campaigns (using the integration screen is a bit tedious, and there's not an easy way to divert success/failure).
